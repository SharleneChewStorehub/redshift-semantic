# ✅ Directory Reorganization Complete

The semantic dictionary directories have been successfully reorganized for clarity and maintainability.

## What Changed

### Before (Scattered Structure)
```
- /semantic_dictionaries/        # v1 individual reports
- /semantic_dictionary/          # Mixed v1.5 and v1.8 content
  - /semantic_dictionary/true_dictionary/  # v1.8 
  - /semantic_dictionary/semantic_layer_v2/  # Current version buried deep
```

### After (Clean Structure)
```
- /semantic_layer_v2/           # ⭐ PRODUCTION (promoted to root)
  - /core/                      # 5 core JSON files
  - /validation/                # Schema validation tools
  - /profiling/                 # Data profiling framework
  - /debug/                     # Debug queries

- /archive/                     # Historical versions with documentation
  - /v1_individual_reports/     # Original approach
  - /v1.5_unified_attempt/      # First consolidation
  - /v1.8_true_dictionary/      # Business glossary approach

- /database_schema/             # Consolidated schema files
  - storehub-table*.sql
  - database_schema*.md

- /docs/                        # Documentation
  - evolution.md
  - migration_guide.md
  - totalreports.md
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Clear Production Version**: semantic_layer_v2 is now at root level
2. **Organized History**: All old versions archived with explanatory READMEs
3. **Consolidated Schemas**: All schema files in one place
4. **Better Documentation**: Evolution and migration guides added
5. **Clean Structure**: No more nested semantic_dictionary folders

## Files Created/Updated

- Created comprehensive READMEs for each archive version
- Created evolution.md documenting the journey
- Created migration_guide.md for upgrading
- Created README_SEMANTIC_LAYER.md as main entry point
- Moved and organized ~50+ files into logical structure

## Next Steps

1. Use `/semantic_layer_v2/` for all production work
2. Reference `/archive/` to understand historical context
3. Check `/docs/` for guides and documentation
4. Validate queries using tools in `/semantic_layer_v2/validation/`

The semantic layer is now clean, organized, and ready for continued development!
