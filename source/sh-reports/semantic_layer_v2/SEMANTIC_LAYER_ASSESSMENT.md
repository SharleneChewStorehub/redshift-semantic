## Key Transformations

### 1. From Assumptions to Data Reality
- **Before**: "Probably has Sale and Return types"
- **After**: Confirmed Sale/Return, discovered Void type exists but excluded

### 2. From Simple to Complex Workflows
- **Before**: "Transactions have a status"
- **After**: 8-stage order lifecycle with operator tracking (system vs customer)

### 3. From Single-Channel to Omnichannel
- **Before**: Basic POS assumption
- **After**: 7 channels including marketplaces (Grab, Shopee, FoodPanda)

### 4. From Generic to Regional
- **Before**: "Businesses operate in multiple countries"
- **After**: Specific tax codes, payment methods, and business practices by country

### 5. From Isolated to Integrated
- **Before**: Separate entities
- **After**: Complex workflows (order→payment→payout→reconciliation)

## Data Quality Insights

### Discovered Patterns
1. **ID Format**: `{business}_{mongoid}` consistently used
2. **Empty String vs NULL**: Most optional fields use '' not NULL
3. **Unicode Support**: Thai, Chinese characters in product names
4. **Test Data**: Significant test accounts in production data

### Missing Data Areas
1. **Loyalty Program**: loyaltychangelogs empty
2. **Reviews**: storereviews table empty

## Conclusion

The data extraction has transformed our semantic layer from a theoretical framework to a production-ready system grounded in real-world patterns. We've moved from ~20% understanding to ~80% coverage of the actual business operations, with clear documentation of what remains to be discovered.

The semantic layer now accurately reflects:
- **Complex business workflows** not initially apparent
- **Regional variations** in operations
- **Multi-channel reality** of modern retail
- **Integration touchpoints** with external systems
- **Data quality patterns** for robust query generation

This positions the semantic layer to generate accurate, optimized SQL queries that respect business rules, leverage actual data patterns, and provide meaningful insights aligned with how the platform actually operates.
