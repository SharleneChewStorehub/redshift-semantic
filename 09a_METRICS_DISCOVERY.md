## Methodology

### Schema Mapping Applied
The following schema mappings were applied during analysis:
* `transformations.mask_businesses` → `storehub_mongo.businesses`
* `transformations.mask_employees` → `storehub_mongo.employees`
* `transformations.mask_customers` → `storehub_mongo.customers`

### Pattern Recognition
Metrics were identified using regex patterns that match common SQL aggregation functions and business calculation patterns. The analysis focused on:
* SUM, COUNT, AVG aggregations
* CASE WHEN conditional logic
* Mathematical operations (subtraction, division)
* Business-specific field names and operations

### Limitations
* Complex nested queries may not be fully captured
* Dynamic SQL or programmatically generated queries may be missed
* Business logic embedded in application code is not included
