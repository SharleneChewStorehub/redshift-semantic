# Semantic Framework Analysis for Multi-Agent System Design

**Date**: January 30, 2025  
**Analysis Purpose**: Multi-agent system architecture design  
**Framework Location**: `source/sh-reports/semantic_layer_v2/core/`  
**Total Framework Size**: 154KB across 6 JSON files  

---

## üìã **Executive Summary**

This analysis examines the semantic framework's 6 JSON files to determine optimal specialization for a multi-agent SQL generation system. Each file serves a distinct purpose in the natural language to SQL translation pipeline, suggesting a modular agent architecture where specialized agents handle specific aspects of query generation.

**Key Recommendation**: Implement a **6-agent pipeline** where each agent specializes in one semantic framework file, avoiding the "information overload" problem observed in monolithic approaches.

## üîç **Individual File Analysis**

### **File Name**: `semantic_context.json`
**Size**: 17KB | **Lines**: 565

**Primary Purpose**: Provides natural language interpretation rules and disambiguation logic to translate ambiguous business terms into precise database concepts.

**Content & Structure**:
- Contains default interpretations for metrics (sales ‚Üí net_sales, customers ‚Üí unique_customer_count)
- Maps time range expressions ("last month", "yesterday") to SQL date logic  
- Defines aggregation level defaults (by store ‚Üí GROUP BY storeid)
- Includes disambiguation rules for handling ambiguous terms with context clues
- Specifies sorting and limit defaults for common query patterns
- Provides context-aware interpretations based on surrounding keywords

**Agent Design Recommendation**: This file is ideal for a **"Natural Language Processing Agent"** that specializes in parsing user questions and resolving ambiguous business terminology before SQL generation begins. This agent would handle the first stage of query interpretation.

---

### **File Name**: `data_catalog.json`
**Size**: 50KB | **Lines**: 1,528

**Primary Purpose**: Provides authoritative mapping between business concepts and physical database objects, including table relationships and pre-built metric calculations.

**Content & Structure**:
- Maps business entities (loyalty_program_management, payment_gateway_operations) to primary tables
- Contains detailed metric definitions with SQL calculations for each business domain
- Documents table relationships and join patterns between related entities  
- Includes volume statistics (54.5M loyalty transactions, 10.2M gateway records) and use case descriptions
- Provides pre-written SQL snippets for common metric calculations
- Covers multiple business domains: loyalty, payments, transactions, customers, products

**Agent Design Recommendation**: This file should power a **"Schema Mapping Agent"** that translates business concepts to correct table/column references and provides accurate join logic between related entities. This agent ensures proper schema-qualified table names and relationships.

---

### **File Name**: `business_rules.json`
**Size**: 23KB | **Lines**: 761

**Primary Purpose**: Enforces data safety, quality constraints, and mandatory filters that must be applied to all queries for security and correctness.

- Contains currency symbols and formatting rules for international operations
- Includes status mappings for transactions, payments, and business processes
- Documents channel types, payment methods, and other categorical enumerations
- Provides transformation rules for data standardization
- Covers multi-country, multi-currency business operations

**Agent Design Recommendation**: This file is ideal for a **"Data Transformation Agent"** that handles international localization, enum value lookups, and ensures consistent data formatting across different regional contexts. This agent would handle value standardization and formatting.

---

### **File Name**: `query_cookbook.json`
**Size**: 10KB | **Lines**: 142

**Primary Purpose**: Provides complete worked examples that demonstrate end-to-end query construction from natural language intent to executable SQL with explanations.

**Content & Structure**:
- Contains real-world examples with natural language questions and SQL solutions
- Includes intent analysis showing how business questions are decomposed
- Provides complete SQL queries with proper joins, filters, and business logic
- Documents parameter requirements and timezone handling patterns
- Explains complex patterns like cohort analysis and retention calculations
- Covers examples: daily sales trends, customer ranking, sales comparisons, product performance

**Agent Design Recommendation**: This file should power a **"SQL Generation Agent"** that uses concrete examples to guide the final SQL construction process, ensuring generated queries follow proven patterns and handle edge cases correctly. This agent handles the final query assembly phase.

## üéØ **Multi-Agent System Architecture Recommendation**

### **Proposed 6-Agent Pipeline Architecture**

Based on this analysis, I recommend a **sequential 6-agent pipeline** where each agent specializes in one aspect of the semantic framework:

```
User Question
     ‚Üì
1. Natural Language Agent (semantic_context.json)
   ‚Üí Disambiguates user intent and resolves terminology
     ‚Üì
2. Schema Mapping Agent (data_catalog.json)  
   ‚Üí Maps concepts to correct tables/columns and relationships
     ‚Üì
3. Security Agent (business_rules.json)
   ‚Üí Enforces mandatory filters and data quality constraints
     ‚Üì
4. Pattern Agent (query_patterns.json)
   ‚Üí Selects appropriate SQL templates and structures
     ‚Üì
5. Transformation Agent (value_mappings.json)
   ‚Üí Handles data formatting, enums, and localization
     ‚Üì
6. SQL Generation Agent (query_cookbook.json)
   ‚Üí Constructs final executable SQL using proven examples
     ‚Üì
Final SQL Query
```

### **Agent Specialization Benefits**

1. **Focused Context**: Each agent receives only relevant information for its specific task
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Avoids the "information overload" problem seen in monolithic approaches
3. **Modular Testing**: Individual agents can be tested and optimized independently
4. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each agent has a well-defined purpose and scope
5. **Scalable Architecture**: New capabilities can be added by extending specific agents

### **Inter-Agent Communication**

Each agent would pass structured data to the next agent in the pipeline:

- **Natural Language Agent** ‚Üí Resolved business terms and intent
- **Schema Mapping Agent** ‚Üí Table/column mappings and join requirements
- **Security Agent** ‚Üí Enhanced query with mandatory filters
- **Pattern Agent** ‚Üí Selected SQL template with parameters
- **Transformation Agent** ‚Üí Standardized values and formatting rules
- **SQL Generation Agent** ‚Üí Final executable SQL query
