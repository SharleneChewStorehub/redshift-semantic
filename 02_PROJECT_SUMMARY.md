### Component Architecture

#### 1. **Semantic Layer Core (JSON Files)**
The heart of the system consists of 5 focused JSON files, each with a specific responsibility:

**Data Flow**: `semantic_context.json` → `data_catalog.json` → `business_rules.json` → `query_patterns.json` → `query_cookbook.json`

- **data_catalog.json**: Maps business concepts to database tables (11 business entities, 1,528 lines)
- **business_rules.json**: Enforces safety constraints and data quality (761 lines)
- **query_patterns.json**: Provides reusable SQL templates (240 lines)
- **semantic_context.json**: Handles natural language interpretation (565 lines)
- **query_cookbook.json**: Contains complete worked examples (142 lines)
- **value_mappings.json**: Maps business codes and enumerations (1,227 lines)

#### 2. **Validation Layer (Python)**
Ensures query safety and schema compliance:
- **Schema Discovery**: Automatically indexes database schemas from SQL files
- **Query Validation**: Pre-execution validation of all table/column references
