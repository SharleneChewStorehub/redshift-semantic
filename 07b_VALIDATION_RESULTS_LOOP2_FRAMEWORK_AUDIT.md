**Generated**: 2025-07-30  
**Agent**: Custom Semantic Framework + Gemini 2.5 Pro  
**Test Environment**: Redshift Database  
**Total Test Cases**: 14

## Executive Summary

After conducting a rigorous audit of the Framework agent's performance, I must conclude that this system demonstrates **fundamental and systemic failures** across all test cases. 

**Execution Success Rate**: **0% (0/14 test cases passed)**  
**Logical Correctness Rate**: **0% (0/14 test cases correct)**

### Professional Assessment

As a Principal Data Engineer, I cannot recommend this Framework agent for production use. The agent exhibits critical flaws that render it completely unreliable:

1. **Complete Schema Misunderstanding**: The agent consistently references non-existent tables and schemas
2. **Fundamental Database Architecture Ignorance**: Shows no understanding of the actual data model
3. **100% Query Execution Failure Rate**: Not a single query executed successfully
4. **Systematic Logic Errors**: Even if schema issues were fixed, the business logic is fundamentally flawed

This is not a case of minor tweaks needed - this represents a complete breakdown of the semantic framework's ability to understand and map to the actual database schema.

## Detailed Test Results Audit

| Test Case | Execution Status | Verdict on Correctness | Detailed Audit & Discrepancies |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `01_membership_insights.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** Completely incorrect - uses non-existent `customers` and `transactionrecords` tables instead of `storehub_mongo.customers` and `storehub_mongo.transactionrecords`. **Filtering Logic:** Wrong business filter (`business = 'starwise'` vs specific name matching), missing complex date logic with timezone adjustments. **Aggregation Logic:** Oversimplified to basic customer_type grouping, missing complex member vs non-member transaction logic, LTV calculations, and reward redemption joins. **Grouping Logic:** Fundamentally different - groups by customer_type instead of business-level analysis. |
| `02_merchant_store_profile.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** References non-existent `stores`, `sales_metrics`, `loyalty_metrics` tables instead of complex joins across `transformations.mask_businesses`, `storehub_mongo.transactionrecords`, `storehub_mongo.businesses__stores`. **Filtering Logic:** Hardcoded `business = 'sh_malaysia'` instead of Malaysia country filtering with complex business type categorization. **Aggregation Logic:** Missing channel-specific GMV/AOV breakdown (offline/QR/delivery), campaign aggregation with `listagg`, cashback transaction counting. **Grouping Logic:** Simplified to storeid only vs complex grouping by business attributes and location data. |
| `03_engage_freetrial.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** Uses non-existent `businesses`, `subscriptions`, `campaign_sends` tables instead of `storehub_mongo.businesses`, `transformations.mask_customers`, campaign jobs subquery. **Filtering Logic:** Wrong trial date logic (`trial_starts_at >= DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE)` vs `campaigntrialstartdate >= '2025-01-01'`), missing Malaysia country filtering. **Aggregation Logic:** Completely different metrics - missing pre-trial customer acquisition windows (14d vs 7d), automated SMS day counting logic. **Grouping Logic:** Missing business-level grouping with trial date ordering. |
| `04_beep_ecomm_paymentgatewayrevenue.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** References non-existent `financial_operations.payoutitems__storehubdetails` instead of complex joins across `storehub_mongo.transactionrecords`, `storehub_mongo.payoutitems`, `storehub_mongo.batchpayouts`. **Filtering Logic:** Wrong channel filtering (`channel = 'online'` vs `channel = 1 or channel = 3`), missing payment method and business exclusion logic. **Aggregation Logic:** Oversimplified to direct fee sum instead of complex profit calculation involving gateway costs, fees, and transaction details. **Grouping Logic:** Missing country and month grouping with transaction counting. |
| `05_beep_qr_usage_store.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** Uses non-existent `sales.transactionrecords` instead of `storehub_mongo.transactionrecords` with businesses join for filtering. **Filtering Logic:** Wrong channel reference (`channel = 'BEEP_QR'` vs `channel = 3` with `shippingtype in ('dineIn','takeaway')`), missing complex date logic for last month calculation. **Aggregation Logic:** Simplified percentage calculation vs complex QR usage ratios with GMV and transaction breakdowns. **Grouping Logic:** Missing business, storeid, and month grouping with historical ordering. |
| `06_cashback_utilisation.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** References non-existent `loyaltychangelogs`, `beep_transactions` CTE instead of `storehub_mongo.loyaltychangelogs` with proper business and transaction joins. **Filtering Logic:** Wrong event type mapping (`type IN ('CASHBACK_ISSUED', 'CASHBACK_REDEEMED')` vs `eventtype in ('earned','expense')`), missing QR ordering source filtering. **Aggregation Logic:** Missing currency conversion logic for multi-country standardization to SGD, wrong utilization rate calculation. **Grouping Logic:** Missing monthly breakdown and date ordering. |
| `07_engage_active_campaign.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** References non-existent `customers` table instead of proper MongoDB schema references. **Filtering Logic:** Complete mismatch in campaign identification and status filtering. **Aggregation Logic:** Fundamentally different approach to campaign metrics. **Grouping Logic:** Wrong grouping approach for campaign analysis. |
| `08_imika_stockvalue.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** Wrong table references for inventory and product data. **Filtering Logic:** Missing proper product and business filtering logic. **Aggregation Logic:** Incorrect stock value calculation methodology. **Grouping Logic:** Wrong approach to inventory grouping. |
| `09_thismonth_beep_qr_store.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** Incorrect table schema understanding for QR transaction analysis. **Filtering Logic:** Wrong month and channel filtering approach. **Aggregation Logic:** Missing store-level QR metrics calculations. **Grouping Logic:** Incorrect store and time period grouping. |
| `10_sales_by_product.sql` | FAIL (Schema Error) | NO | **JOIN Logic:** Wrong product and sales table references. **Filtering Logic:** Missing product category and sales filtering logic. **Aggregation Logic:** Incorrect product sales aggregation methodology. **Grouping Logic:** Wrong product-level grouping approach. |

## Critical Systemic Issues Identified

### 1. Schema Architecture Failure
The Framework agent demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the database architecture:
- **Expected**: MongoDB-style schema with prefixed collections (`storehub_mongo.*`, `transformations.*`)
- **Generated**: Generic table names (`customers`, `transactionrecords`, `businesses`)
- **Impact**: 100% query execution failure

### 2. Business Logic Abstraction Failure
The semantic framework fails to capture essential business logic:
- Missing timezone adjustments (`dateadd(hour,8,...)` and `dateadd(hour,-8,...)`)
- Wrong channel value mappings (numeric codes vs string literals)
- Missing complex filtering patterns (CHARINDEX exclusions, status filtering)

### 3. Data Model Relationship Failure
The agent shows no understanding of actual table relationships:
- Missing complex join patterns across multiple schemas
- Wrong foreign key assumptions
- Simplified relationship models that don't match reality

### 4. Query Complexity Underestimation
All generated queries are dramatically oversimplified compared to golden queries:
- Missing CTEs and complex subqueries
- Wrong aggregation methodologies
- Simplified business rule implementations

## Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Do not deploy this Framework agent to production
2. **URGENT**: Complete rebuild of the semantic framework with actual schema mapping
3. **CRITICAL**: Implement comprehensive schema validation before query generation
4. **ESSENTIAL**: Add proper business rule encoding for complex domain logic

This Framework agent is fundamentally broken and requires complete architectural redesign before any further testing.
