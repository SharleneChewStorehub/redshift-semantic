# DEEP RESEARCH & VALIDATION PROMPT
**Target:** Advanced LLM Research Agent (Gemini/GPT-4)  
**Project:** StoreHub Redshift Semantic Layer Architecture Validation  
**Requestor:** Principal Data Architect Review Team  

---

## OBJECTIVE

**Primary Goal:** To validate the architectural choices of an internal data project against modern best practices and find alternative solutions for its identified risks.

**Specific Focus:** The project implements a custom 5-layer JSON-based semantic layer for Natural Language to SQL translation in a multi-tenant retail/F&B environment. We need to determine if this approach is justified or if simpler, more robust alternatives exist.

**Expected Outcome:** A comprehensive research report that either validates the current approach or provides concrete evidence for simpler, industry-standard alternatives.
